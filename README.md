# Dungeon Survivors

Dungeon Survivors is a top down shoot 'em up style video game I made to learn the SDL multimedia library and low level
game architecture in general. The game is currently in VERSION 2. I plan to add more content to the game eventually, but 
the only updates in the near future will be balancing updates.

## Essence

You fight off a horde of enemies in wave based combat. After surviving each wave, you have the option to upgrade one of
four attributes to prepare for the stronger and faster mobs of the next wave.
